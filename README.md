### ðŸ“˜ Title:

**Python Basics with Numpy **

---

### ðŸ§¾ Description:

This Jupyter Notebook is a hands-on assignment from the **Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI**. It is designed to introduce learners to **basic Python programming**, **NumPy operations**, and the importance of **vectorization** in deep learning.

Even if you already have some experience with Python, this notebook serves as a useful warm-up to familiarize yourself with the functions and practices that will be used throughout the specialization.

### ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Learn:

By the end of this notebook, you will:

* Understand and use **iPython Notebooks**
* Implement **basic mathematical functions** using Python and NumPy
* Understand **sigmoid functions** and their derivatives
* Convert images into vectors
* Normalize vectors and implement the **softmax function**
* Learn how to **vectorize** operations and avoid slow Python loops
* Implement **L1 and L2 loss functions**
* Understand **broadcasting** in NumPy

---

### ðŸ§  Topics Covered:

#### 1. Introduction to Python in Jupyter Notebook

* How to use interactive cells
* Writing and running code in iPython

#### 2. Numpy and Vectorization

* Sigmoid function and its derivative
* Reshaping arrays with `.reshape()`
* Image to vector transformation
* Row normalization with `np.linalg.norm()`
* Softmax function

---

### ðŸ§ª Exercises Included:

Each section includes coding exercises to reinforce your understanding:

* `basic_sigmoid(x)`
* `sigmoid(x)` using `np.exp`
* `sigmoid_derivative(x)`
* `image2vector(image)`
